# AutoCV
## ðŸŒŸ About the Project
LinkedIn provides automatic resumes that users can download. This resume isn't the best, it can be multiple pages long, the design isn't the most professional, and people may prefer other styles. AutoCV aims to allow users to create different resume designs easily, by transforming the layout and design of the original LinkedIn resume. Users upload their pdf LinkedIn resume, AutoCV analyzes it and uses a mix of scraping and AI to gather all the info, and then designs different resume styles.

### â›µ This project was built for [Hack Club's Shipwrecked](https://shipwrecked.hackclub.com/)

## ðŸ§° How-to
To download your LinkedIn resume you have to first be on the web version of Linkedin. Then go to your profile > Resources > Save to PDF. Then upload this pdf when prompted on AutoCV. Everything else is on us!
